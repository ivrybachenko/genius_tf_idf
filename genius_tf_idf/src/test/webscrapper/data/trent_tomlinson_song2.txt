[Verse 1]
Yeah, once again your kiss just blew me away
I ain't ever felt like this or ever found any words to say
How I feel when you're with me, girl I need to let you know
So here it goes, here I go

[Chorus]
For the life of me, I just can't remember
Ever being one time ever that you weren't on my mind
And for the life of me, yeah baby I just can't see
Myself, my heart, my soul not loving you for the life of me

[Verse 2]
When I look at you tonight, hey it only lets me know
That I would be a fool if I ever let you go
So, if you feel like I feel, I'll lean in for another kiss
'Cause girl you're it, for me you're it

[Chorus]
For the life of me, I just can't remember
Ever being one time ever that you weren't on my mind
For the life of me, yeah baby I just can't see
Myself, my heart, my soul not loving you for the life of me

[Bridge]
For the life of me, I don't know why
It's taking this long for me to say it just right
And baby tonight when I look in your eyes
Gonna lay it on the line

[Chorus]
For the life of me, I just can't remember
Ever being one time ever that you weren't on my mind
And for the life of me, yeah baby I just can't see
Myself, my heart, my soul not loving you for the life of me
For the life of me
